<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>The Miles MP3 decoder is amazingly fast - it contains both Intel and AMD 3DNow optimized versions. On a P3/300, full 44 Khz stereo decoding takes as little as 3% of the CPU. On a Mac, it takes half the CPU hit of the QuickTime decoder! </p><p>You can cut the CPU hit almost linearly by dropping the sample rate, and/or the number of channels. For example, 44 Khz mono takes as little as 1.5%. </p><p>In general, we've seen very few places where the CPU hit of MP3 is a problem. Remember that if you are streaming audio in off a drive, you usually take a larger CPU hit just in IO overhead (which MP3 will actually mitigate because you are reading a tenth as much data).</p></td></tr>
