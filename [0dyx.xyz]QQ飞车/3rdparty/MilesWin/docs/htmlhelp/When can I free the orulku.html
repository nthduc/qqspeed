<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>Since Miles plays out of your memory buffers, you can't free the memory until you know that Miles is done with it. </p><p>For example, if you've pointed Miles at some audio data with <a href="AIL_set_sample_file.html">AIL_set_sample_file</a>, you can't free the memory until <a href="AIL_sample_status.html">AIL_sample_status</a> returns <a href="MILES_DIGITAL_STATUS.html#SMP_DONE">SMP_DONE</a>. You can call <a href="AIL_end_sample.html">AIL_end_sample</a> to instantly force the status to <a href="MILES_DIGITAL_STATUS.html#SMP_DONE">SMP_DONE</a>. </p><p>Occasionally, a crash will occur when a Miles user is freeing sample memory that will cause them to think that Miles is still using the data even after the status has changed to <a href="MILES_DIGITAL_STATUS.html#SMP_DONE">SMP_DONE</a>. </p><p>Over the last ten years, there have a fair number of folks convinced that this is what was happening (with varying degrees of certainty). In <b>all</b> cases, something else was causing the crash - memory corruption (which using causes a crash in <i>free</i>), another sample was also playing from the address, etc. Just remember - if <a href="MILES_DIGITAL_STATUS.html#SMP_DONE">SMP_DONE</a> has been set, you can free the memory as long as another sample isn't using it. Guaranteed! </p></td></tr>
