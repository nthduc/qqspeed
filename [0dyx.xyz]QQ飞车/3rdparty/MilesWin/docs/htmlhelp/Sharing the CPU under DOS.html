<h1>Sharing the CPU under DOS</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Under DOS, Miles does most of its work in background interrupts. This means that Miles usually does its work without you even having to worry about it. The mixing and buffer submission to low-level sound drivers all happens without your intervention. </p><p>The only time you may need to specifically give Miles CPU time is when you are streaming files with the high-level streaming functions. DOS applications can't do I/O in the background, so if you are streaming, you have to periodically call <a href="AIL_service_stream.html">AIL_service_stream</a>. </p><p>Miles does take control of the system timer interrupt. If your game already uses the hardware timer, then you are usually best off converting your interrupt routines into Miles timers. They are just as accurate and allow everything to get along nicely. If you must control the clock, then contact RAD for details on patching the required functions in the Miles source code. </p>
