<h1>Creative's EAX 4 Preferences</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p> The EAX 4 provider publishes many provider-level and sample-level preferences (for setting) and attributes (for reading) that allow game developers to set interesting room styles. These preferences include all of the EAX 3 properties too. </p><p>But more interesting are the new EAX 4 features, which provide hardware support for many common DSP filters. EAX does this by providing multiple "slots" that you can load a DSP filter into. You then direct your sound effects into one of these slots to hear the filtered sound. </p><p>There are currently four of these slots, but the first two are fixed function: slot 0 is environmental reverb, and slot 1 is a chorus filter. You can load other filters into slots 2 and 3. You can even have multiple environmental reverbs, one in slot 0, one is slot 2 or 3, for example. </p><p>Each 3D sound can only be routed to either no slots, one slot, or two slots at a time. That means you can have a single sound being flanged and ring modulated at once, for example. </p><p>Miles massively refactors the EAX 4 API (which is otherwise quite complicated). To load a filter, you simply set the parameters for that filter - this will first load the filter, and then set the parameters. To activate a filter, you simply set the volume - this will send the sound to the filter and then set the volume level. </p><p>All of the filters are loaded by passing a particular structure to the <a href="AIL_set_3D_provider_yxmz5e.html">AIL_set_3D_provider_preference</a> function. Each structure is specific to the filter that you are trying to load. We don't change these structures at all from the EAX versions, so you can also read the EAX docs for more info on each filter. </p><p>The best way to learn how to use the EAX 4 features is to check out the EAX4EXAM.CPP file - it is an extremely simple and clear example that show how to use each of the EAX 4 filters. </p><p><b>The current EAX 2 provider-level preferences are:</b> </p><p><b><i>All of the EAX provider-level preferences.</i></b> </p><p><b><i>All of the EAX 2 provider-level preferences.</i></b> </p><p><b><i>All of the EAX 3 provider-level preferences.</i></b> </p><p><b>"EAX4 Reverb parameters": </b> this preference takes a pointer to a <a href="EAX_REVERB.html">EAX_REVERB</a> structure. When you set this preference, it first loads the Reverb filter (if it hasn't already been loaded), and then it updates each of your settings. The Reverb filter can be loaded into slots 0, 2 and/or 3 - it is the basic EAX environmental reverb filter. See the EAX 4 documentation for more details on this complicated filter. </p><p><b>"EAX4 Auto Gain parameters": </b> this preference takes a pointer to a <a href="EAX_AUTOGAIN.html">EAX_AUTOGAIN</a> structure. When you set this preference, it first loads the Auto Gain filter (if it hasn't already been loaded), and then it updates each of your settings. The Auto Gain filter can be loaded into slots 2 and/or 3. See the EAX 4 documentation for more details on this simple filter. </p><p><b>"EAX4 Autowah parameters": </b> this preference takes a pointer to a <a href="EAX_AUTOWAH.html">EAX_AUTOWAH</a> structure.

See the EAX 4 documentation for more details on this filter. </p><p><b>"EAX4 Equalizer parameters": </b> this preference takes a pointer to a <a href="EAX_EQUALIZER.html">EAX_EQUALIZER</a> structure. When you set this preference, it first loads the Equalizer filter (if it hasn't already been loaded), and then it updates each of your settings. The Equalizer filter can be loaded into slots 2 and/or 3. See the EAX 4 documentation for more details on this filter. </p><p><b>"EAX4 Flanger parameters": </b> this preference takes a pointer to a <a href="EAX_FLANGER.html">EAX_FLANGER</a> structure.

See the EAX 4 documentation for more details on this filter. </p><p><b>"EAX4 FShifter parameters": </b> this preference takes a pointer to a <a href="EAX_FSHIFTER.html">EAX_FSHIFTER</a> structure. When you set this preference, it first loads the Frequency shifter filter (if it hasn't already been loaded), and then it updates each of your settings. The Frequency shifter filter can be loaded into slots 2 and/or 3. See the EAX 4 documentation for more details on this filter. </p><p><b>"EAX4 VMorpher parameters": </b> this preference takes a pointer to a <a href="EAX_VMORPHER.html">EAX_VMORPHER</a> structure.
