<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> This preference controls the maximum predelay you can use when applying 2D digital reverb. The longer the predelay, the more memory is required (4 bytes * the output frequency). <br><br> This preference value must be changed before calling <a href="AIL_open_digital_driver.html">AIL_open_digital_driver</a>. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS.

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> This preference determines the whether the MSS mixer should perform sound filtering when upsampling or downsampling a sound effect. This is a very low overhead operation, so you should generally just leave this preference turned on. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Boolean ( YES / NO ). <br><br> Default Value: YES.</td>

<td width=29% height=25 valign=middle class=list><a name="#DIG_MIXER_CHANNELS" href="#DIG_MIXER_CHANNELS" class=trn>&nbsp;DIG_MIXER_CHANNELS</a></td>
<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> DIG_MIXER_CHANNELS determines the number of HSAMPLE sample handles which may be allocated with the <a href="AIL_allocate_sample_ijfaaa.html">AIL_allocate_sample_handle</a> and <a href="AIL_allocate_file_sample.html">AIL_allocate_file_sample</a> functions. The <a href="AIL_create_wave_syntrqseaa.html">AIL_create_wave_synthesizer</a> function also allocates a number of sample handles which is determined by its polyphony parameter value. At any moment in time, each instance of a playing digital sound effect requires one HSAMPLE handle. <br><br> The value of this preference may be increased if desired, but system performance may be degraded if too many samples are played simultaneously. The practical limit depends on the hardware DMA data rate in use and the system's capabilities. For example, it may be possible to play hundreds of samples simultaneously with an 11- kHz 8-bit mono driver configuration running on a high-end PC system, while only one or two simultaneous samples should be played on a 386-class system whose sound driver is configured for 16-bit stereo 44 Khz DMA transfers. Because scaling source sample data to a given hardware configuration consumes a relatively small amount of CPU time, the hardware (DMA) data rate being used affects system performance to a much greater extent than does the playback rate, number of channels, and word size of the source sample data. <br><br> Any changes made to the DIG_MIXER_CHANNELS preference value must be made prior to installing the digital driver in question. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: # of simultaneous digital sound effects permitted. <br><br> Default Value: 64.</td>

<td width=29% height=25 valign=middle class=list><a name="#DIG_RESAMPLING_TOLERANCE" href="#DIG_RESAMPLING_TOLERANCE" class=trn>&nbsp;DIG_RESAMPLING_TOLERANCE</a></td>
<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> When the playback rate of a sample passed to MSS differs from the hardware sample rate in use (as defined by the DIG_HARDWARE_SAMPLE_RATE preference), the data must be resampled to play at its normal speed and pitch. This resampling process requires a minute amount of CPU time beyond that required to play data which does not need to be resampled. By setting the DIG_RESAMPLING_TOLERANCE preference prior to initializing a digital audio driver, the application can specify that no resampling is to occur if the source sample data does not vary from the hardware data rate by more than a certain percentage. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Tolerance percentage expressed as (n / 65536). <br><br> Default Value: 0% (0).</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> This preference value determines how many HTIMER handles may be allocated with <a href="AIL_register_timer.html">AIL_register_timer</a>. Any changes to this preference value must be made immediately after <a href="AIL_startup.html">AIL_startup</a> is called. <br><br> AIL_TIMERS should not normally need to be changed by the application, except in cases where more than 16 timer service clients, including XMIDI drivers and application callback functions, must be serviced. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Number of timers which can be allocated with <a href="AIL_register_timer.html">AIL_register_timer</a>. <br><br> Default Value: 16.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> When an XMIDI music driver is loaded, the MSS API arranges to receive background timer interrupt service at a rate governed by the MDI_SERVICE_RATE preference. The timer routine is responsible for background playback of XMIDI sequences. <br><br> This preference also controls the rate at which sequences are converted with the <a href="AIL_MIDI_to_XMI.html">AIL_MIDI_to_XMI</a> function. <br><br> Any changes to the MDI_SERVICE_RATE preference must be made prior to XMIDI driver installation. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Frequency in hertz (interrupts per second). <br><br> Default Value: 120.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> MDI_SEQUENCES determines the number of HSEQUENCE sequence handles which may be allocated with the <a href="AIL_allocate_sequenc2icfaa.html">AIL_allocate_sequence_handle</a> function. At any moment in time, each instance of a playing XMIDI sequence requires one HSEQUENCE handle. <br><br> The value of this preference may be increased if desired, but the set of 16 physical MIDI channels may limit the number of sequences which can be played simultaneously. Most applications should not need to increase the MDI_SEQUENCES limit. <br><br> Any changes made to the MDI_SEQUENCES preference value must be made prior to installing the XMIDI driver. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: # of simultaneously playing XMIDI sequences permissible. <br><br> Default Value: 8.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> The MDI_DEFAULT_VOLUME preference value determines the default volume-scaling factor assigned to all channels of all sequences by the <a href="AIL_init_sequence.html">AIL_init_sequence</a> function. <br><br> By default, the individual channel volume controller values in XMIDI sequences are not scaled by MSS. <br><br> This preference value does not ordinarily need to be changed, since the volume-scaling factor for any XMIDI sequence may be altered at any time by use of the <a href="AIL_set_sequence_volume.html">AIL_set_sequence_volume</a> function. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: MIDI-compatible volume controller units (0-127). <br><br> Default Value: 127.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> This preference value allows the <a href="AIL_sequence_position.html">AIL_sequence_position</a> function to report the XMIDI beat and measure count for a given sequence in advance of their actual occurrences. <br><br> For more information about this preference, refer to the description of the <a href="AIL_sequence_position.html">AIL_sequence_position</a> function. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: XMIDI quantization intervals (0...n). <br><br> Default Value: 1.</td>

<td width=29% height=25 valign=middle class=list><a name="#MDI_ALLOW_LOOP_BRANCHING" href="#MDI_ALLOW_LOOP_BRANCHING" class=trn>&nbsp;MDI_ALLOW_LOOP_BRANCHING</a></td>
<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> When an <a href="AIL_branch_index.html">AIL_branch_index</a> function call is issued, or an XMIDI Sequence Branch controller (109) is encountered in a playing XMIDI sequence, any XMIDI For...Next/Break loops defined with controllers 116 and 117 are canceled in the sequence in question. This is done to prevent errors caused by branches into or out of loops. In cases where branching within a looped portion of a sequence is required, and the musician and programmer are willing to ensure that branches across loop boundaries never occur, the MDI_ALLOW_LOOP_BRANCHING preference may be set to YES to avoid loss of loop information when a branch is taken. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Boolean (YES / NO). <br><br> Default Value: NO.</td>

<tr valign=top class=list>
<td width=29% height=25 valign=middle class=list><a name="#MDI_DEFAULT_BENDER_RANGE" href="#MDI_DEFAULT_BENDER_RANGE" class=trn>&nbsp;MDI_DEFAULT_BENDER_RANGE</a></td>
<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> One important feature introduced with the MSS version 3.00 release was the official support of the Roland Sound Canvas's de facto General MIDI implementation as the baseline standard for XMIDI performance parameters, replacing the obsolete Roland MT-32 standard under which the older libraries were designed. The default pitch bender range under the MT-32 MIDI standard was plus or minus 12 notes, or semitones, but the Sound Canvas established a new default value of two semitones. <br><br> It is possible to adjust the pitch bend range in a MIDI channel at performance time by setting MIDI Registered Parameter Number 0's data MSB to the new bender range value. However, existing sequences composed under MSS 2.X are not likely to contain RPN 0 controller values, since the older Roland-derived MIDI standard did not recognize RPN events. It may be desirable to set the MDI_DEFAULT_BENDER_RANGE preference to 12 when porting MSS 2.X applications to the current MSS, if adding RPN controllers to all of the application's MIDI sequences is impractical. Changes to MDI_DEFAULT_BENDER_RANGE take effect during XMIDI driver initialization. <br><br> This function may not be supported by all Windows midiOut drivers. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: MIDI semitones (discrete note increments). <br><br> Default Value: 2.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> This preference value determines the size of the largest System Exclusive message which can be transmitted from an XMIDI file or from the <a href="AIL_send_sysex_message.html">AIL_send_sysex_message</a> function. <br><br> MDI_SYSEX_BUFFER_SIZE should not normally need to be changed by the application. <br><br> Environment: Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Bytes. <br><br> Default Value: 512.</td>

<td width=29% height=25 valign=middle class=list><a name="#MDI_DOUBLE_NOTE_OFF" href="#MDI_DOUBLE_NOTE_OFF" class=trn>&nbsp;MDI_DOUBLE_NOTE_OFF</a></td>
<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> This preference value is present to help you work around a nasty bug in the Sound Blaster 16 General MIDI daughter cards. Occasionally the interface portion of the Sound Blaster 16 can drop General MIDI commands when there is busy MIDI traffic. Most MIDI commands can be dropped without a problem, but if a "Note-Off" is missed, then your MIDI notes can "stick". <br><br> When you turn this preference on, then MSS will send all Note-Off commands to the MIDI card twice (creating less of a chance that the Note-Off will be missed). This preference will nearly double the MIDI traffic, so use it if you have problems with stuck notes on Sound Blaster 16 daughter cards with very complicated MIDI songs. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Boolean (YES / NO). <br><br> Default Value: NO.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> Governs the rate at which the DLS software synthesizer receives periodic timer service from the system. Lower rates may yield slightly better CPU performance in some cases; higher rates yield less "quantization" of MIDI traffic. There is no benefit in setting the DLS_TIMEBASE preference value higher than the MDI_SERVICE_RATE preference value, as MIDI events cannot be interpreted faster than they arrive from the synthesizer driver. <br><br> This preference value must be altered before calling <a href="AIL_DLS_open.html">AIL_DLS_open</a>. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Frequency in hertz (interrupts per second). <br><br> Default Value: 120.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> Sets the maximum number of simultaneous DLS synthesizer voices available.

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> By default, the XMIDI Patch Bank Select controller (114) is not used as an alias for the General MIDI bank select controllers (0 and 32). The XMIDI Patch Bank Select controller has been de-emphasized by RAD Game Tools as of the MSS 4.0 release, and should not be used for future compositions. Legacy compositions which use XMIDI Patch Bank Select may be made DLS-compatible by setting this preference to YES. <br><br> If this preference is set to YES, the General MIDI Bank MSB value for a given channel (controller 0) will be set to 0 whenever a Patch Bank Select controller is encountered in that channel. <br><br> This preference value may be altered on demand at runtime. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Boolean (YES / NO). <br><br> Default Value: NO.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> DLS-synthesized instruments contain numerous level scalars and articulators, all of which, when interpreted by the synthesizer, result in a reduction of overall output volume compared to the levels at which the wave data were originally recorded. By default, the synthesizer output level is boosted by 10 dB in the final mixing stage, to help keep DLS-synthesized music from being drowned out by digital sound effects and other sources of sound in an application. <br><br> This preference value may be altered on demand at runtime. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Decibels. <br><br> Default Value: 10.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> By default, MIDI data which is not interpreted by the DLS software synthesizer is passed on to the default MIDI hardware synthesizer driver. Setting this preference to NO causes uninterpreted data to be discarded. Many applications which deal with "legacy" sequence data may benefit from setting this preference to NO, to avoid unwanted or inappropriate output from the MIDI hardware synthesizer in response to events in tracks which are not properly configured with bank- and/or patch-change messages. <br><br> This preference value may be altered on demand at runtime. <br><br> Environment: DOS/Win32/MacOS. <br><br> Units: Boolean (YES / NO). <br><br> Default Value: YES.</td>

It determines whether MSS will use DirectSound or the low-level Windows multimedia extensions (MME). <br><br> By default, MSS tries to load DirectSound and only falls back to waveOut if DirectSound fails to load or if DirectSound is using emulation mode.

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> This preference determines the whether the MSS mixer should mix into a DirectSound secondary buffer, or whether it should mix directly into the primary sound buffer. The primary sound buffer is the very fastest method, but not all sound cards are compatible with primary buffer use.

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> Under DOS, when a digital audio driver is loaded, the MSS API arranges to receive background timer interrupt service at a rate governed by the DIG_SERVICE_RATE preference. The timer routine is responsible for polling the driver's low-level buffer status to determine which, if either, of the two half-buffers is ready to be filled with the next block of output audio data. In general, to ensure that MSS has enough time to prepare the next audio data block for the driver, DIG_SERVICE_RATE should be set to a frequency which is substantially faster than the driver's half-buffer playback period. As an example, consider a hardware driver which is configured to play 16-bit audio at 20,000 Hz with a pair of 1,000-byte half-buffers. The driver's data rate is 40,000 bytes per second, implying a half-buffer playback frequency of 40,000 / 1,000, or 40 Hz. (The half-buffer playback frequency is referred to as the driver's DMA latency, and can be controlled by the use of the DIG_LATENCY preference described below.) For reliable performance in this example, DIG_SERVICE_RATE should be set to a value which is greater than 40 by a comfortable margin - at least a factor of two, or 80, would be appropriate here. <br><br> DIG_SERVICE_RATE must be set prior to calling the <a href="AIL_install_DIG_driv6dbdaa.html">AIL_install_DIG_driver_file</a> or <a href="AIL_install_DIG_driv6zzyaa.html">AIL_install_DIG_driver_image</a> function. <br><br> The default DIG_SERVICE_RATE value of 200 Hz has been chosen as a conservative compromise between CPU overhead and audio reliability with most applications. This value should be increased only when extremely low DMA latencies are specified by use of the DIG_LATENCY preference, or if very brief fragments of audio seem to be "repeated" unnaturally. <br><br> Environment: DOS only. <br><br> Units: Frequency in hertz (interrupts per second). <br><br> Default Value: 200.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> Under DOS, this preference governs the actual DMA or simulated-DMA transfer rate used by digital audio drivers. When a driver is loaded by the application, MSS must choose one of three sample rates supported by the driver, and initialize the driver for DMA or simulated-DMA playback at that sample rate. MSS's choice of sample rates is based on the DIG_HARDWARE_SAMPLE_RATE value. The three sample rates permitted by the driver represent the minimum, nominal, and maximum values supported by the hardware device for which the driver was developed. For example, the minimum, nominal, and maximum hardware sample rate values for SBLASTER.DIG are 4000, 11111, and 22222 Hz, respectively; while the values supported by SB16.DIG are 11025, 22050, and 44100 Hz, respectively. Of course, the application may specify any desired sample rate for playback of its audio data; it is MSS's responsibility to resample the application's audio data to conform to the driver's hardware playback rate. (See the description of the <a href="AIL_set_sample_playbug1eaa.html">AIL_set_sample_playback_rate</a> function for more information about oversampling and undersampling, and their potential effects on audio quality). <br><br> By default, the nominal sample rate (NOM_VAL) value is selected when initializing each digital audio driver. Prior to driver initialization with the <a href="AIL_install_DIG_driv6dbdaa.html">AIL_install_DIG_driver_file</a> or <a href="AIL_install_DIG_driv6zzyaa.html">AIL_install_DIG_driver_image</a> function, this preference may be set to the MIN_VAL, NOM_VAL, or MAX_VAL. Alternatively, an explicit sample rate value may be supplied to the <a href="AIL_set_preference.html">AIL_set_preference</a> function for the DIG_HARDWARE_SAMPLE_RATE preference. In this case, MSS will select the closest match from the three sample rate choices offered by the driver. Use of MIN_VAL for this preference is not recommended except in cases where only low-frequency sound effect samples are to be played, or when system performance constraints cause severe problems at higher data rates. Similarly, use of MAX_VAL may impose a significant burden on foreground CPU performance when drivers capable of 44 kHz operation are loaded. A few system-board and video-adapter combinations exhibit impaired DMA performance at higher physical sample rates, especially when monochrome text adapters are installed alongside ISA-based VGA adapters operating in high-resolution modes. Additionally, many sound adapters incorporate low-pass antialiasing filters which adapt themselves to the hardware sample rate. On these adapters, use of higher-than-necessary hardware sample rates will often result in a loss of playback fidelity when MSS must oversample the application's data. In general, best fidelity will be obtained by matching the hardware DMA and source sample data rates as closely as possible. Consequently, it is strongly recommended that the application select an explicit value for the DIG_HARDWARE_SAMPLE_RATE preference which is equal to the playback rate of the majority of the samples to be played, and let MSS's resampling capability handle the others. <br><br> This preference is only used under DOS. Under other platforms, the values specified in the call to <a href="AIL_open_digital_driver.html">AIL_open_digital_driver</a> govern the final sound output quality. <br><br> Note that MSS does not permit hardware sample rates to be changed at any time after driver initialization. To establish a different hardware sample rate, it is necessary to shut down and reinitialize the driver. Note also that MSS drivers must be shut down in their opposite order of initialization. <br><br> Environment: DOS only. <br><br> Units: MIN_VAL, NOM_VAL, or MAX_VAL; or explicit frequency in hertz (samples per second). <br><br> Default Value: NOM_VAL.</td>

In particular, frequent video memory accesses - especially in super-VGA modes with ISA-based video subsystems - may interfere with high-speed DMA traffic, or vice versa. Disk or network traffic can also interfere with high-bandwidth DMA transfers, especially in the presence of virtual DMA hosts.

This should not be taken as a warning to leave MSS's more advanced features unused, but rather as encouragement to keep hardware DMA rates no higher than necessary to meet the application's needs.

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> Under DOS, MSS is unique among 32-bit PC sound systems in that its architecture permits it to be compatible with Microsoft Windows virtual DOS machines, or "DOS boxes."

This message can often be avoided by waiting for a short period of time after the last sound is played by the Windows Multimedia Extensions before launching the MSS application's DOS session. The error which causes the dialog box to appear stems from design inadequacies in the Microsoft multimedia system, and is not a symptom of a problem with MSS (or any other DOS-based PC sound system). <br><br> Environment: DOS only. <br><br> Units: Boolean (YES / NO). <br><br> Default Value: YES.</td>

<td width=71% height=25 valign=middle class=list> Under DOS, this preference governs the "lag time" between the execution of an MSS function call which affects digital audio playback, and the actual execution of the requested command. It determines the DMA half-buffer size to be configured when digital drivers are installed, as expressed in terms of the half-buffer playback time in milliseconds based on the DMA data rate in use. <br><br> The Miles Sound System digital audio mixer operates on the application's audio data in small chunks, called <i>blocks</i>. Part of the system's responsibility is to poll the hardware buffers in the background to determine when the next block of audio data from the application should be processed and copied into an empty DMA half-buffer. As an example, consider a hardware driver which is configured to play 16-bit audio at 20,000 Hz with a pair of 1,000-byte half-buffers. The driver's <i>data rate</i> is 40,000 bytes per second, implying a half-buffer playback rate of 40,000 / 1,000, or 40 buffer transitions per second. <br><br> At a rate of 40 times per second, then, a sample block equivalent to one half-buffer's worth of data is fetched from the application's sample data buffer at the current playback position. The samples are resampled if necessary to conform to the driver's hardware rate, converted between 8-bit and 16-bit formats where appropriate, mathematically scaled for volume and panpot control, algebraically added to data from other active samples, clipped, and copied into the driver's empty half-buffer to be played as soon as the other half-buffer finishes playing. <br><br> Consequently, any change made to a sample's playback characteristics - be it a change in volume, panpot value, pitch, start/stop status, or playback position - must wait until the next DMA half-buffer transition occurs before it can take effect. <br><br> The DMA latency setting represents a compromise between the ability of the system to maintain consistent sound quality in the presence of heavy interrupt loads associated with disk access and other sources, and its ability to respond quickly to requests from the application to start, stop, or otherwise affect the playback of digital audio samples. If too high a latency time is requested, annoying delays may occur between the time a sample is started and the time the user actually hears the sound. High DMA latency times are particularly undesirable when using "virtual wave synthesis" to trigger digital drum or instrument sounds with XMIDI sequence events. Conversely, too low a DMA latency setting may cause brief dropouts and "skips" during digital audio playback which takes place while disk, CD, or network access is occurring. This symptom may become quite pronounced on slower systems. <br><br> MSS's default DMA latency setting is 100 milliseconds, which is the longest recommended DMA latency period. (If the AIL_ALLOW_VDM_EXECUTION preference is set to its default value of YES, the DMA half-buffer size is limited to 2KB rather than 16KB. With higher sample rates, especially in combination with an 8-bit mono hardware channel, the actual DMA latency time will be much less than 100 milliseconds). <br><br> The minimum acceptable DMA latency figure will generally be in the range of 15-25 milliseconds. If extremely small DMA latency values are used, it may be necessary to increase the value of the DIG_SERVICE_RATE preference to give the system enough time to respond to the driver's DMA half-buffer transitions. <br><br> It is important to note that the DIG_LATENCY preference value is used during driver installation as a guideline only. Under the MSS architecture, DMA half-buffer sizes must be chosen from among the set of binary powers between 16 and 16,384 bytes. The DIG_LATENCY value, in conjunction with the DIG_HARDWARE_SAMPLE_RATE, DIG_USE_STEREO, and DIG_USE_16_BITS values, determines which of the possible buffer sizes is used. In most cases, the chosen buffer size will be only an approximation to the size which corresponds to the requested half-buffer playback time. If a change to DIG_LATENCY seems to have no effect as compared to the previous value, try making a slightly larger change in the same direction until the desired result is achieved. <br><br> Environment: DOS only. <br><br> Units: Milliseconds. <br><br> Default Value: 100.</td>
