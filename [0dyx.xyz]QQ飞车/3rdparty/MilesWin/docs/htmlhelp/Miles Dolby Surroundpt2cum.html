<h1>Miles Dolby Surround M3D Provider</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p> The Miles Dolby Surround M3D provider is a run-time surround sound encoder. Using multi-speaker systems like those from Cambridge Soundworks, Boston Acoustics, and Altec Lansing (or any other surround sound system), this provider can play audio from the rear speakers - allowing real (non-simulated) 3D sound positioning. </p><p>The Miles Dolby Surround M3D provider is based on the Miles 2D API which makes it extremely fast! It also means that you can control the reverb preferences described in the Miles 2D-based M3D Preferences chapter. </p><p>Note that using the Miles Dolby Surround M3D provider does not give you the right to use the Dolby Logo. To use the Dolby logo, you must become a Dolby Surround licensee (the criteria to do this are listed below). </p><p> <b>Overview of Dolby Surround</b> </p><p>A Dolby Surround soundtrack carries four audio channels (left, center, right, and surround) in a two-channel stereo format. Creating a Dolby Surround soundtrack involves mixing down these four audio channels and encoding then into a final stereo mix using a Dolby Surround encoder (like the run-time version built into Miles). For linear tracks, a Dolby Surround encoder, model SEU-4, and Dolby Surround decoder, model SDU-4, are used. There is also a plug-in available for users of Digidesign's Pro Tools system. </p><p>For sound effects which need to be positioned on the fly, you should use the Miles Dolby Surround provider. </p><p><b>On Becoming a Dolby Surround Licensee</b> </p><p>In order to become a Dolby Surround Licensee, which grants you the right to use the Dolby Surround Logo, four basic criteria need to be met: </p><p>I. You must use a Dolby-approved, real-time encoding scheme, such as the Miles Dolby Surround provider. </p><p>II. You must use a Dolby-approved Surround facility to encode the linear audio in your game. </p><p>III. You must sign a royalty-free trademark agreement, which grants a license to use the Dolby Surround trademark, subject to these conditions. </p><p>IV. You must send a sample of the finished title at, or prior to, the time of release. </p><p>For more information on becoming a Surround licensee, or to request a licensing agreement, please contact Dolby directly: </p><p>Dolby Laboratories, Inc.<br> Encoding Services Department<br> 100 Potrero Ave.<br> San Francisco, CA 94103-4813<br> Tel: 415-558-0200<br> Fax: 415-863-1373 </p><p>For more information on producing in Dolby Surround, please visit the Dolby <a href="http://www.dolby.com/multi/">web-site</a>. </p><p>For technical questions on producing content in Dolby Surround, please <a href="mailto:multimedia@dolby.com">E-mail</a>. </p><p>To request a licensing agreement via email, please <a href="mailto:tsa@dolby.com">E-mail</a>. </p>
