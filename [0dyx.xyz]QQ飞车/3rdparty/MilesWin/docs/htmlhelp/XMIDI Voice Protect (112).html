<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p> < 64: Voices playing in channel assume normal priority (release voice protection) </p><p>>= 64: Voices playing in channel assume highest possible priority (assert voice protection) </p><p>Available on some synthesizers, voice protection is an XMIDI feature which allows a sequence to discourage the polyphonic voice assignment algorithm from "stealing" synthesizer voices from notes played in a given MIDI channel when no free voices are available. If the Voice Protect controller's value is less than 64, voices assigned to notes playing in the channel will be considered for reassignment to play incoming note events. This is the default condition for each channel. Otherwise, the "voice priority" of notes in the channel will constantly assume its maximum value, preventing the channel's notes from being robbed of their voices. Voice protection should be used conservatively and released as soon as possible, since the synthesizer emulation code works best when allowed to make its own decisions regarding voice allocation. </p>
