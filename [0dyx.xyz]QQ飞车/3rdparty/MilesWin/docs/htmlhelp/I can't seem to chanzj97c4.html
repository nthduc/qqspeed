<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>This is probably because your XMIDI sequence doesn't have any default volume events. Miles can't change the volume of a sequence until the baseline level is specified with a MIDI volume event. Have your musician insert volume events at the beginning of the sequence and you should be able to then control the volume with <a href="AIL_set_sequence_volume.html">AIL_set_sequence_volume</a>.</p></td></tr>
