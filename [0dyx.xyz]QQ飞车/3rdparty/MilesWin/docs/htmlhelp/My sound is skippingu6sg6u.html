<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>Under Win32 and MacOS X, mixing happens on a background thread (on the other Miles platforms, mixing occurs on an interrupt). Unlike interrupts, threads are subject to starvation - that is, depending on CPU load, one thread can be neglected for a period of time. </p><p>When that happens to the Miles mixing thread, then the digital audio can "skip" momentarily. Fortunately, on NT based Win32 platforms and fast Macs on Mac OS X, this rarely happens - you really have to try to cause a skip. Unfortunately, on the Windows 9x based platforms and on slower Macs, it is fairly easy to cause the Miles thread to starve. The easiest way to trigger starvation is to do a lot of sustained disk IO on an IDE-based device. </p><p>So, regardless of the cause of the problem, we just want the user to have a good experience. A simple way to fix the problem is to just mix ahead farther - if we mix ahead 200 milliseconds, then we can tolerate a thread dropout of up to 200 ms with no trouble! The only problem is that now our latency is 200 ms - fine for some games, but terrible for others! </p><p>Fortunately, there is a good compromise. By using the <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> function, you can track the length of the thread starvations as they occur. </p><p>So, let's say you have a game that skips when you read in the level data from the disk. The best way to fix the problem is something like this: </p><p>1) Call <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> before you start the IO (this clears the previous high value). </p><p>2) Do all your IO. </p><p>3) Call <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> and record it. </p><p>Run your game on a couple machines and keep track of the high value. It's usually going to be something around 150 milliseconds, but get a good reading with your game's pattern of IO. </p><p>Now we just bump up the latency during the IO and then bump it back down after - you get the best of both worlds - good latency in the general case, and enough mix ahead to handle the IO dropouts. Once you know roughly what latency you have to cover, simply do something like this: </p><p>1) On Win32, call <a href="AIL_set_preference.html">AIL_set_preference</a> on <a href="MILES_PREFERENCES.html#DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT">DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT</a> to your highest timer delay divided by 8 (each fragment in Miles is 8 ms on Win32). </p><p>On MacOS, call <a href="AIL_set_preference.html">AIL_set_preference</a> on <a href="MILES_PREFERENCES.html#DIG_SM_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT">DIG_SM_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT</a> to your highest timer delay divided by 20 (each fragment in Miles is 20 ms on the Mac). </p><p>2) Call <a href="AIL_serve.html">AIL_serve</a> to make sure that the mix-ahead buffer is filled. </p><p>3) Do all your IO. </p><p>4) On Win32, call <a href="AIL_set_preference.html">AIL_set_preference</a> on <a href="MILES_PREFERENCES.html#DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT">DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT</a> to set it back to its default value of 8. </p><p>On MacOS, call <a href="AIL_set_preference.html">AIL_set_preference</a> on <a href="MILES_PREFERENCES.html#DIG_SM_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT">DIG_SM_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT</a> to set it back to its default value of 20. </p></td></tr>
