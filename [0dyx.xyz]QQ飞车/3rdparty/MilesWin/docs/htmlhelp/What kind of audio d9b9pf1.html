<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>Miles supports IMA ADPCM decompression, MPEG Layer 3 decompression, Voxware voice decompression, and Xbox ADPCM hardware decompression on the Xbox platform. </p><p>IMA ADPCM is a simple format that provides 4 to 1 compression on 16-bit data. There is essentially no CPU hit for decoding ADPCM - it's that simple. Like all ADPCM variants, it is somewhat hissy, though. </p><p>MPEG Layer 3 (or MP3) is a very complicated format that usually provides 11 to 1 compression with no audible loss. It does use a fair amount of CPU, though. See the "What is MPEG Audio and MP3?" <i><a href="What is MPEG Audio aqqdaaa.html#FAQ">FAQ</a></i> for more details about MP3. </p><p>The Voxware voice codecs are complicated formats that provide up to 200 to 1 compression on voice data (fairly compressed-sounding, though). They are only for voice data, though - they can't do anything at all with music or sound effects. The Voxware codecs are used almost exclusively for Internet voice chat. </p><p>On the Xbox, Miles can also play Xbox ADPCM with no CPU hit at all - it is transparently decoded in hardware. </p></td></tr>
