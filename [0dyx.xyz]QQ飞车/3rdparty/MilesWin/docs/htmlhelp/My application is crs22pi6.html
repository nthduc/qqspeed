<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>Here's my quick list of things to ask yourself when you get a crash. Most of them seem really obvious, but one of these questions solves pretty much every technical support query we get! </p><p>Go through the questions one by one and <b>don't assume</b> the answer to any of them - actually explore each question. Without fail, the most complicated crashes are usually reduced to one simple assumption that was never completely confirmed. </p><p>1) What call is crashing? Does it crash every time, or just once in a while? </p><p>2) If you cut that call into one of the Miles sample applications, does it still crash? </p><p>3) Is the problem data-dependent? Do other sound files work? </p><p>4) Don't overlook the obvious - what are the contents of the parameters being passed to the crashing function? Are they valid? Double-check them at run-time in the debugger. </p><p>5) Are you using the latest version of Miles? See the "What is the latest version of MSS?" <i><a href="What is the latest vpbjt32.html#FAQ">FAQ</a></i> for details. </p><p>6) Make sure that the header file, the DLLs and shared libraries, and all of the add-ons files (the ASIs, FLTs, M3Ds, etc) are all the same version! Scan your drive for the Miles library files - make sure there are none on your drive except the very latest version. </p><p>7) Miles is used in a <b>lot</b> of games (about 700 per year). If you are getting a crash, try to imagine what is different about your application - are you doing anything you'd guess is unusual? </p><p>8) Try never freeing your sound memory buffers. You'll leak memory, but if you don't crash, then you are probably freeing a piece of memory before Miles is done with it. See the "When can I free the memory I gave to MSS?" <i><a href="When can I free the orulku.html#FAQ">FAQ</a></i> for details. </p><p>9) Does it happen on a specific machine? On a specific OS? Does it only happen with a particular sound card? Do you have the latest sound card drivers for your sound card? </p><p>10) Does it only happen with a particular 3D provider? </p><p>11) Examine the Miles call log (see the call logging sections in the Overview sections). Does anything appear unusual? </p><p>12) Build the Miles DLL in debug mode - can you tell what's happening from the crash location in the source code? See the "How can I rebuild the Miles source code?" <i><a href="Where is the Miles slsp9cm.html#FAQ">FAQ</a></i> for details. </p><p>13) Try simplifying the problem. Turn off everything unnecessary (DSP filters, spacialization, reverb, etc.) - does it affect the crash? </p><p>14) Are you using callbacks? Try turning them off completely - does it still crash? </p><p>15) Finally, if you've been able to reproduce a crash in Miles, send me the example (keep it short and simple - the console applications in the \Examples directory are a good place to start) and we'll get it fixed for you. RAD can usually fix reproducable problems within days! </p></td></tr>
