<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>If you can't play an MP3 file, try these troubleshooting questions: </p><p>1) Did you copy all the redistribution files into a directory available to your application? </p><p>2) On Win32, MacOS and Linux, did you call <a href="AIL_set_redist_directory.html">AIL_set_redist_directory</a> to tell Miles where this directory is? This directory is relative to the location of the Miles library file, so if you are using a relative path - make sure it is relative to the right directory! </p><p>2) On Xbox and DOS, did you call Register_RIB(MP3Dec) to tell Miles to load the MP3 decoder? </p><p>3) If you are using the 2D API, are you using <a href="AIL_set_named_sample_file.html">AIL_set_named_sample_file</a> to tell Miles what type of data it is? </p><p>4) Did you sign the license agreement for MP3 decoding? This is a separate license addendum that your company might have chosen not to sign. Look for the ASI codec library files (*.ASI in Win32) in the redistribution directory - are they present? </p><p>5) Is the file in question an MP3 file? Miles doesn't play MPEG Layer 1 or MPEG Layer 2 files which are often mistakenly labeled MP3 files. Try recompressing the file yourself just to be sure. </p></td></tr>
