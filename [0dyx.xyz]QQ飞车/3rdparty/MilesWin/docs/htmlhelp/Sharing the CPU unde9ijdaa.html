<h1>Sharing the CPU under MacOS</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Under MacOS 9 and below, Miles does most of its work in background interrupt functions. This means that Miles usually does its work without you even having to worry about it. The mixing and buffer submission to Sound Manager all happens without your intervention. </p><p>The only time on MacOS 9 and below that you may need to specifically give Miles CPU time is if you are using the QuickTime MIDI synthesizer which requires you to service it with the <a href="AIL_serve.html">AIL_serve</a> function. The Miles synthesizer usually sounds better and takes less CPU time, though, so this usually is unnecessary. </p><p>Under MacOS X, Miles does most of its work in a background thread. Again, this means that Miles usually does its work without you even having to worry about it and that the mixing and buffer submission to the sound hardware all happens without your intervention. </p><p>The only time on MacOS X, that you may need to specifically give Miles CPU time is if the system thread scheduler starts performing badly and the background Miles thread starves. Under the MacOS X, the thread scheduler usually has the most trouble when performing disk I/O. </p><p>Miles provides several techniques to handle thread-starvation. See the <a href="AIL_get_timer_highesqwlaaa.html">AIL_get_timer_highest_delay</a> function as well as the "My sound is skipping on Win32 or MacOS X - what can I do?" <i><a href="My sound is skippingu6sg6u.html#FAQ">FAQ</a></i> for more details. </p>
