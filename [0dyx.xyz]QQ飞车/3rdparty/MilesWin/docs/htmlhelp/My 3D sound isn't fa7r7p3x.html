<tr valign=top><td><p>A:</p></td><td><p>This is a common source of confusion. Basically, the most important thing to remember is that the maximum distance has <b>nothing</b> to do with the volume falloff curve! <b>Only the minimum distance matters for the falloff curve.</b> </p><p>The volume of a sample falls off by half every time the minimum distance is doubled. So, if you set your minimum distance to 3, then this falloff curve is in effect: </p><p>Distance: less than or equal to 3 meters. Volume: 100%.<br> Distance: 6 meters. Volume 50%.<br> Distance: 12 meters. Volume 25%.<br> Distance: 24 meters. Volume 12.5%.<br> Distance: 48 meters. Volume 6.25%.<br> etc... </p><p>So, you can see that the maximum distance doesn't affect the volume falloff curve at all! The maximum distance just sets a hard clip point - the volume is forced to be zero at maximum. </p><p>Also note that some DirectSound drivers don't implement the maximum distance correctly with the DSBCAPS_MUTE3DATMAXDISTANCE flag in effect (which Miles uses). At the maximum distance on these drivers, the volume doesn't drop to zero, instead, it just stops falling off.</p></td></tr>
