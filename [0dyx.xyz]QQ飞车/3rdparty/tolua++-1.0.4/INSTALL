This version of tolua++ uses SCons to compile (http://www.scons.org). SCons uses
pythin. If you don't want to install python, check "Installation without scons"
below.

* Installation

	1. Edit the "config" file for your platform to suit your environment,
	   if at all necessary (for cygwin, mingw, BSD and mac OSX use
	   'config_posix')
	2. Then, type "scons".
	
  You can use 'scons -h' to see a list of available command line options.

* What you get

  If "scons" succeeds, you get:
	* an executable to generate binding code in ./bin;
	* the C library to be linked in your application in ./lib;
	* the include file needed to compile your application in ./include.
  These are the only directories you need for development, besides Lua.

  You can use 'scons install' to install the files, see the 'prefix' option.

* Installation without scons

  The instructions for building tolua++ without scons depend on the particular
  compiler you are using.
  The simplest way is to create a folder with all .c and .h files except
  'toluabind_default.c', and then create a project for the executable and the
  library, as follows:

  tolua.exe: all *.c *.h in src/bin (except toluabind_default.c)
  tolua.lib: all *.c *.h in src/lib.
