Debugging Applications for Microsoft .NET and Microsoft Windows

This directory contains project files that are compatible with Visual
Studio .NET 2002.  I simply saved off all the .SLN, and .*PROJ files at
the time I moved over to using Visual Studio .NET 2003 full time.

*************************************************************
** THESE PROJECTS/FILES MAY NOT BE UP TO DATE!             **
** PLEASE DON'T ASK ME FOR HELP BACK PORTING A PROJECT!    **
** THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED! **
*************************************************************

These projects do not point to the source files.  I copied over all the
Visual Studio .NET 2002 projects as they were.  If you want to attempt
compiling one of my projects with Visual Studio .NET 2002, copy the
project and solution files from this directory over top the Visual
Studio .NET 2003 versions.
