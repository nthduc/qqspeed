Helpful Hints for Maximizing Your CrashFinder Pleasure

- This version has wondeful updates from Scott Bloom,
Ching Ming Kwok, Jeff Shanholtz, and Pablo Presedo!
They added the code to add all dependencies, the ignore
image list, and the much improved Find dialog.  Thanks
to all of them for the great code.

- Please read my book, "Debugging Applications" from 
Microsoft Press for a complete discussion of CrashFinder.

- In a nutshell, CrashFinder can help you find the source, line,
and function where a crash occured when you only are given
the a hexadecimal address from a beta tester, or worse yet,
your boss!  CrashFinder works with both Visual Basic and
Visual C++ programs.

- A CrashFinder Project is an EXE and it's associated DLLs
and OCX's.  Create a new CrashFinder Project and add the
main EXE with all the DLLs/OCXs it loads by pressing Ctrl+A
to insert them.  After all the binaries are loaded, press
Ctrl+F to find the source, line and function of any
hexadecimal crash address.

- CrashFinder works best with DBGHELP.DLL from Windows
2000.  Additionally, to build the CrashFinder sources you 
will need to install the latest Platform SDK.

- You need to make your release builds with debug symbols
by setting the options in your VB project or VC makefile.
A program compiled without debug symbols should never
leave your shop.
CL.EXE -> /Zi
LINK.EXE -> /DEBUG /OPT:REF

- TURNING ON DEBUG SYMBOLS DOES NOT MEAN 
THAT YOU ARE DOING A DEBUG BUILD.  THE 
DEBUG SYMBOLS ARE IN YOUR PDB FILES SO 
UNLESS YOU ARE GIVING THOSE TO YOUR 
CUSTOMERS, YOU ARE NOT GIVING AWAY ANY 
SECRETS.

- You need to either use REBASE on you DLLs so that they
all load at a unique address space or set the base address
for each DLL manually in your IDE.  If you ever see the
statement below, when running your release build under a
debugger, you should be very worried.  Not only is this
making it impossible to figure out where your application
crashed, you are slowing down the DLL load time
considerably.  The offending statement: (The XXX and YYY
are the two DLLs with a conflict)

LDR: Dll xxx base 10000000 relocated due to collision with
YYY

- You should keep copies of the binaries that you send out in
a very safe place.  This way CrashFinder will find any
addresses correctly with exactly what is out in the field.
You should put your .PDB files with the binaries as well.

- To keep your relationship from crashing, you should give
your partner a big hug and tell him or her that you love
them every day.
