; This is the file that controls the DLL base addresses.  It is included
; as part of the LINKER command line options.
;
; The format is:
; key address size
;
; For the sizes, I added up at the sizes of the code, initialized data,
; and uninitialized data and multiplied that number by 2.  That should
; give plenty of room to grow.
;
; Note that BUGSLAYERUTIL.DLL is set directly on the command line because
; it is used by other projects on this CD.

i386cpuhelp    0x62000000     0x50000
